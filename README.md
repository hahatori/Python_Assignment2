![welcome](https://github.com/hahatori/Python_Assignment1/blob/master/images/welcome1.jpg)

This is an independent Assignment. You can find the contents, software，and license down here. This README.md file describes the entire repository, like how it can be run, problems and solutions, the expected and actual results, etc. In addition, this directory contains the main program, environment and some required files. 

My student id is 201308685.

## Introduction



See the description of **README.md**. These documents provides details about every respository, how to run the software, what to expect when it is run, outline any ‘known issues’ and outline any testing done.

## Software

This project uses [Python](https://www.python.org), [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) and [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

**Python** is a cross-platform computer programming language. Is an object-oriented dynamically typed language that was originally designed to write automated scripts (shells) and is increasingly being used for independent, large-scale project development as versions are updated and new features are added to the language.

**Anaconda** is an open source Python package manager that contains more than 180 science packages including conda, Python and their dependencies for computational science (data science, machine learning, big data processing and predictive analysis).

**Spyder** is a simple integrated development environment. Its main advantage over other Python development environments is that it mimics the "workspace" of MATLAB, making it easy to view and modify array values.

**Jupyter** is an interactive computing environment that supports more than 40 programming languages. Easy to create and share documentation of literary programs, support real-time code, mathematical equations, visualization, and documentation. Applications include data cleansing and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning, etc.

## Assignment

This project including [in.txt](https://github.com/hahatori/IO/blob/master/in.txt), [in.txt](https://github.com/hahatori/IO/blob/master/in.txt), [agentframework.py](https://github.com/hahatori/IO/blob/master/agentframework.py) and [model.py](https://github.com/hahatori/IO/blob/master/model.py).

## Run

### how it can be run

This project uses [Anaconda]() and [Spyder](). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

The last GUI file to run is created by modifying the code from the first few files. Agents and models interact with each other, import agents and other python packages by running the model.py to output the results.

## Issues


## Results

### Theoretical Results(what is to be expected when it is run)

The expected result is the agents can interact with each other and have a GUI that shows the animation by input or modify parameters.  

Modify the IPython console from GUI.py to run to produce a separate window, called "My Model". The top left corner displays the window menu called "Model". Click on the menu displays a drop-down list named "Run model", continuing to click on it，displays an scatter plot animation.
